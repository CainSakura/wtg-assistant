<h1>Description of Windows To Go(WTG)</h1>

"Windows To Go(WTG)" is a technology originally provided by Microsoft.
It allows you to fully install Windows on portable devices such as USB flash drives, portable hard drives, etc.,
 and can run directly on different computer hardware, so that the system can be carried with you!
It's not a WinPE, nor a simplified version, but a complete Windows operating system, which is almost the same
as a normal installation.

<h1>About Windows To Go Assistant(WTGA)</h1>
The Windows To Go Assistant(WTGA) provides a convenient and quick method to deploy Windows To Go on USB devices. Meanwhile, our community forum 
can provide effective technical support.

<h2>Motivation:  </h2>
Initially, there is no GUI tool to deploy WTG, the only way is to use Command Line until the the official WTG creation tool was built in the Enterprise edition of Windows.
The official tool is simpliy and stable enough, but it lacks some custom settings. Also, there are some portable devices that do not compatible with it.
